🔍 What is Program Management?
Program Management is the practice of coordinating multiple projects that contribute to a common business goal. Unlike project management, which focuses on individual projects, program management looks at the bigger picture, ensuring:

✅ Strategic alignment of projects
✅ Resource sharing & efficiency
✅ Risk mitigation & issue resolution
✅ Improved collaboration & reporting

💡 Fun Fact: According to PMI, organizations with strong program management see a 27% higher success rate in achieving business objectives.
