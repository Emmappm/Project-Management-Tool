What is a Gantt Chart?
A Gantt chart is a visual project management tool that helps teams plan, track, and execute tasks efficiently. It displays task dependencies, timelines, and progress in a bar chart format, making it easier to manage complex projects.

In 2025, businesses are increasingly using Gantt chart tools within project tracking software to improve integrated project management and enhance productivity.

Why Businesses Need a Gantt Chart for Project Management
Without a Gantt chart, project teams may experience:

❌ Poor task visibility, leading to missed deadlines
❌ Lack of collaboration, causing inefficiencies
❌ Unclear dependencies, making task sequencing difficult
