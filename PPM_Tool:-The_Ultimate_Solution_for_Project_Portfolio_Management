What is a PPM Tool?
A PPM (Project Portfolio Management) tool is a software solution designed to help businesses plan, manage, and optimize multiple projects efficiently. It enables strategic project selection, resource allocation, risk management, and performance tracking across an organization’s entire project portfolio. Unlike basic project management tools, which focus on individual project execution, a PPM tool provides a holistic view of all projects, ensuring they align with business objectives.
