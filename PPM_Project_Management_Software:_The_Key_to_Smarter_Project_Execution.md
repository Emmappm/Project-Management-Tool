What is PPM Project Management Software?
PPM (Project Portfolio Management) project management software is an advanced tool that helps organizations manage multiple projects, optimize resources, track financials, and align project execution with strategic goals. Unlike traditional project management software, which focuses on individual projects, PPM software provides a holistic view of an organization’s entire project portfolio, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions.
